#Revisiting BankAccount
test
This problem set will require you to have finished pset1extra, so if you haven't done that yet, now might be a good time.

There are many different types of bank accounts in the world: savings, checking, etc. We want to update our BankAccount design to utilize these different account types.

For this problem set assume the following:

* Interest only accrues on savings accounts
* Checking accounts should be able to have some amount of overdraft protection (withdrawing more funds than are available)
* Checking accounts require the payment of a monthly fee

Consider how these changes will affect the original design. Write some tests for these improvements, implement the additional functionality, and test, test, test!

When you are finished, commit and push your code, and notify an instructor.
